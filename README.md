#Weather App

A super simple es6 react app (my first toy react app) that uses the openweather api to fetch weather data for a given city. It's bundled and served up via webpack.

##Install

1. ```git clone https://github.com/diegoconcha/weather-app.git```
2. In a terminal run ```npm install```
3. In the same terminal run ```npm run start```
4. Browse to: ```localhost:8080```
5. Enjoy! :smiley:



Refactor Goals:
- [ ] Add Test / CI
- [ ] favor classless react
- [ ] Refactor Search API with RXJS 
- [ ] Add Favorites feature using redux 
- [ ] Update UI
- [ ] Add Service Worker
